#For this we use prefix sum and a hash map to find the ans
# to find the longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s, treat 0 as -1 and keep a running prefix sum. each time the prefix is 0, 
# it means all elements up to that point are balanced, so update the 
# answer to i + 1.

# use a dictionary to store the first index where each prefix value 
# appears. if the same prefix occurs again, the subarray between those 
# indices has an equal number of 0s and 1s, so update the maximum length 
# with i - count[prefix]. if the prefix hasnâ€™t appeared, store it with 
# the current index.

# this approach runs in O(n) time and O(n) space. the main idea: 
# repeating prefix values indicate balanced subarrays between their 
# indices.

# to find the longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s, convert each 0 to -1 
# so the problem becomes finding the longest subarray with a sum of 0. 
# keep a running count that increases with 1s and decreases with 0s.

# use a hash map to store the first index where each count appears, 
# starting with {0: -1} to handle subarrays from the start. as you loop, 
# if the current count has been seen, update the maximum length using
#  i - counter_mp[count]; otherwise, store the index.


# the algorithm runs in O(n) time and O(n) space. the key idea: when the
# same count repeats, the subarray between those points has 
# equal 0s and 1s.
